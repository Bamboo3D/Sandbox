Features
--------

-   Visually create and edit your Panda3D scene graph
-   Preview your scene in real-time within the editor
-   Import 3D models and textures into your scene
-   Position, rotate, and scale objects in your scene
-   Create and manipulate lights and cameras
-   Add physics simulation to your objects using the Bullet physics engine
-   Export your scene graph to a Panda3D Python script

Installation
------------

To use Bamboo3D, you need to have Python and Panda3D installed on your computer. You can download Panda3D from the official website (<https://www.panda3d.org/>). Once you have installed Panda3D, you can download the latest release of Bamboo3D from the Github repository (<https://github.com/Bamboo3D/Bamboo3D/releases>). Extract the downloaded files to a folder on your computer.

Usage
-----

To start Bamboo3D, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the Bamboo3D files. Run the following command:

`python main.py`

This will start the Bamboo3D editor. To create a new scene, click the "New" button in the toolbar. To open an existing scene, click the "Open" button and select the scene file (.bam) you want to open.

Once you have a scene open, you can use the various tools in the editor to create and edit objects in your scene. You can select an object by clicking on it in the viewport or in the scene graph panel. You can then use the transform tools in the toolbar to position, rotate, and scale the object.

To add a new object to your scene, click the "Create" button in the toolbar and select the type of object you want to create (e.g., model, light, camera). You can then use the object properties panel to customize the object's appearance and behavior.

When you are done editing your scene, you can export it to a Panda3D Python script by clicking the "Export" button in the toolbar. This will save the scene graph to a Python script (.py) that you can use in your Panda3D project.
